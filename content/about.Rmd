Hi! Welcome to my website.  

I'll use it to save some code snippets and data analysis done using R on open data.

I currently work as a data scientist for Desjardins Groupes d'Assurances Générales, a property insurance company located in Lévis, Canada.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars, pch = 20)  # not really cool
```
