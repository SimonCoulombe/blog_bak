Hi! Welcome to my website.  

I'll use it to save some data analysis and code snippets, mostly done using R.

I currently work as a data scientist for Desjardins Groupes d'Assurances Générales, a property insurance company located in Lévis, Canada.

```{r cool-plot, fig.width='80%', fig.cap='A cool plot.'}
plot(cars, pch = 20)  # not really cool
```
